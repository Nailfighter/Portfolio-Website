      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am fascinated by the intersection of
        <span> art</span> and <span>technology</span>, especially when it comes
        to fronend development , computer graphics and interactive media like{" "}
        <span>VR and AR</span>. Ever since I was young, I have been amazed by
        the magic of video games and animated movies, curious how millions of
        tiny pixels could come together to create such immersive experiences.
        That curiosity sparked a desire to understand the underlying principles,
        leading me to explore the world of <span>computer science</span>.
        <br />
        <br />
        Right now, I am really getting into
        <span>fullstack development</span>, <span>computer graphics</span>, and
        <span> cloud computing</span>. I enjoy playing around with new ideas and
        tools, whether it is building websites or creating cool simulations. I
        love tackling challenges and coming up with creative solutions.
        <br />
        <br />
        When Iâ€™m not working in tech, I enjoy taking <span>
          photographs </span>
        and love
        <span> hiking</span>. There is something refreshing about being out in
        nature, and it is a great way to clear my mind and find inspiration. I
        often bring my camera along to capture the beautiful moments I encounter
        along the way.
